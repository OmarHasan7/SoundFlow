# SoundFlow

**SoundFlow** is a Chrome extension that automatically pauses currently playing browser media tab when the user starts playing media in another tab. This ensures a seamless audio experience by preventing multiple audio tracks from playing simultaneously.

## Features
- Automatically detects and pauses playing soundtracks.
- Resumes paused tracks when the new track stops (optional).
- Simple and intuitive interface.
