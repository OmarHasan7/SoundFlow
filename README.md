# SoundFlow

**SoundFlow** is a Chrome extension that automatically pauses currently playing browser soundtracks when the user starts another track. This ensures a seamless audio experience by preventing multiple audio tracks from playing simultaneously.

## Features
- Automatically detects and pauses playing soundtracks.
- Resumes paused tracks when the new track stops.
- Simple and intuitive interface.

<!-- ## Installation

1. **Add SoundFlow from the Chrome Web Store:**
   - Go to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions) and search for "SoundFlow".
   - Click "Add to Chrome" to install the extension. -->
## State
**still under development**
<!-- ## Usage

1. Once installed, the extension runs in the background.
2. When a new audio track is played while another is already playing, SoundFlow will automatically pause the previous track.
3. When the new track stops, SoundFlow will resume the paused track.
